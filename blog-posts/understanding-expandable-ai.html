      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, the need for scalable and adaptable architectures becomes more critical. One promising approach to meet this demand is Expandable AI — a framework designed to grow in capability, knowledge, and compute capacity over time without complete system redesigns.

      <h2>What is Expandable AI?</h2>
      <p>
        Expandable AI refers to AI systems that are architected with modularity and scalability at their core. These systems are designed to integrate new data sources, models, and processing power dynamically, enabling continuous learning and real-time evolution.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔹 Modular neural networks that allow plug-and-play model extensions</li>
        <li>🔹 Dynamic knowledge bases that grow with context</li>
        <li>🔹 API-first designs enabling seamless integrations</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Why Does Expandability Matter?</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional AI models often require complete retraining when new information or requirements arise. Expandable AI mitigates this by allowing:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Scalable inference capabilities through edge-to-cloud pipelines</li>
        <li>Multi-agent collaboration and interoperability</li>
        <li>Personalization without compromising global model integrity</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Applications of Expandable AI</h2>
      <p>Industries are rapidly adopting expandable AI to future-proof their AI strategies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🏥 Healthcare: Adding new disease detection modules without model retraining</li>
        <li>📦 Supply Chain: Adaptive logistics predictions based on real-time data</li>
        <li>🎮 Gaming: NPCs learning and evolving from player interactions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        While Expandable AI offers numerous benefits, it also introduces complexities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔐 Security risks in modular integrations</li>
        <li>⚖️ Maintaining fairness across evolving datasets</li>
        <li>🔄 Synchronization across distributed intelligence units</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Expandable AI represents a paradigm shift from static model deployment to dynamic, evolving intelligence. As the demand for real-time personalization and large-scale automation grows, so does the importance of AI systems that can evolve without limits. Designing with expandability in mind is not just a technical preference — it’s a strategic necessity.
